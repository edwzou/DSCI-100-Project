    "- Heart disease is the second leading cause of death in Canada. Diagnosing heart disease is a rigorous and time consuming process, and misdiagnoses is still a relevant concern with around 16%-68% misdiagnosis depending on setting. Therefore, finding an easier and more reliable way of diagnosis will be very beneficial to patients as well as doctors. Our group’s chosen data set tries to tackle the problem of identifying an individual who has heart disease by comparing their attributes to patients already diagnosed with heart disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Clearly state the question you will try to answer with your project*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we use a heart disease dataset to create a model that can reliably and correctly predict whether a new patient has heart disease more than 84% of the time? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Identify and describe the dataset that will be used to answer the question*\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will be using the heart disease dataset provided on Canvas (processed Cleveland version). This dataset consists of 14 attributes that aid in predicting whether or not an individual has heart disease. There were four datasets from four different institutions (Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, VA Long Beach) provided, but we chose to use the Cleveland data because the website has stated that the Cleveland data set was the only data set that has been used by ML researchers.\n"
